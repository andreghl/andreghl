## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

I am AndrÃ©! An Economics student at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. I am interested in Econometrics and would like to pursue a Master's in Econometrics in the Netherlands. I usually like to work with ```R```, but I am open to learning new languages.

### Why Programming?

What amazes me the most about programming is the fact that everything seems possible. The only limit to your creativity is your own mind, and thus it is always nice to try to push the boundaries of what you know.

### Experience

Although my programming knowledge is very limited, I do happen to have some experience in ```R```, and ```Julia``` which I have used extensively during my courses, but I still need to motivate myself to learn ```Python```. I have followed an introductory ```Java``` course in November and December of 2024.
