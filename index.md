I am a BSc Economics student at Maastricht University in the Netherlands with an interest in Econometrics. This website is a place to write about my interests and to further improve my knowledge in hopes of pursuing a Master's in Econometrics, Actuarial Sciences, or a related field, and possibly a PhD.
