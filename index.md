*This is corner of the internet where I write about various topics I find interesting.* I am a MSc Econometrics and Operations Research student at Maastricht University in the Netherlands and I have recently graduated with a BSc in Economics and Business Economics at the same university. I am interested in statistics and the intersection between programming and economics.
