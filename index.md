*The corner of the internet where I write about various topics I find interesting.* I am a BSc Economics and Business Economics student at Maastricht University in the Netherlands with an expected graduation in July 2025 and my coursework has mainly focused on economic theory and econometrics. In September 2025, I will start a master's in Econometrics and Operations Research.
