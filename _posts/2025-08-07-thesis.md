In order to fulfil the requirements of a bachelor's degree, students at Maastricht University School of Business and Economics (SBE) must write a thesis. The thesis can either take the form of a research proposal, a literature review, or a small-scale research paper. My interest in economic research led me to sign up for the **MaRBLe** program which allows students to engage in a small-scale research project. While the experience was interesting,nI did not fully take advantage of the research opportunity offered by the program. In this article, I discuss this research experience and the potential improvements for future research projects.

## Lesson 1 - Start early



## Comments

---
- Thesis focuses on the role of awareness and individual attitudes for preferences regarding distribution towards families

- Survey is developed and competently implemented; results are discussed in detail

- Thesis is generally well-written

- Research question and relations between variables of interest and redistribution preferences should have been formulated more clearly and explained in more detail. Also, it remains somewhat unclear how the literature explained in the review section link to the survey items and the survey design

- Variable descriptions/explanations and descriptive analyses should have been more extensive

- Choice of definitions of indicator variables should have been explained; potential alternatives should have been considered

- Choice of specific regression models should have been motivated; alternative specifications would have been useful (e.g., integration of all attitudes into one model)
