The data exploration segment led to the selection of ten potential independent variables. The selection of these variables was largely motivated by the conclusions of industry articles and are presented below.

| **Variable**  | *Description* |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| policy_tenure | Time period of the policy |
| age_of_car | Normalized age of the car in years |
| age_of_policyholder | Normalized age of policyholder in years |
| area_cluster | Area cluster of the policyholder |
| population_density | Population density of the city (Policyholder City) |
| make | Encoded Manufacturer/company of the car |
| segment | Segment of the car (A/ B1/ B2/ C1/ C2) |
| model | Encoded name of the car |
| engine_type | Type of engine used in the car |

The two models are estimated on a randomly selected subset of observations and the models are estimated using a binomial logistic regression. The first model contains 3 independent variables namely ```age_of_car```, ```age_of_policyholder```, ```policy_tenure``` and has an AIC of 434.26 and the second model contains 6 explanatory variables which includes ```segment```, ```make```, ```population_density``` and the three variables already included in the first model.
