In a recent course at the Norwegian School of Economics, we delved into the mathematical modeling of financial markets. The course was restricted to the study of markets composed of one risk-free asset, a bond, and one or more risky assets such as stocks and financial derivatives. The pricing of financial derivatives is a crucial issue in finance and relies on the condition of non-arbitrage.

The non-arbitrage assumption guarantees that there exists no possibility of riskless profit in the market model. In other words, any investment strategy with a positive expected return must have a cost greater than $0$. I believe that the investors, in these market models, assumed to be rational to some extent, would never participate in a losing trade. Trading can be seen as a zero-sum game as a transaction can only happen between two agents with diametrically opposed expectations about the future price of the security. No investor would trade with the expectation of making a loss or allowing the other agent make a profit.
