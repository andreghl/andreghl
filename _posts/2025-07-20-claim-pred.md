In Spring of 2024, I joined a workshop organized by AXA Germany at the Maastricht Business Days. The actuaries presented their work in the auto insurance segment of the business and tasked us with determining the best model specification to most accurately predict insurance claims in the auto insurance sector.

## Data

The dataset contains $58,592$ observations of $44$ variables and short descriptions of the variables are provided in the table below. The dataset is larger than what I am used to both in terms of observations and number of variables but I doubt that all the variables are relevant.

| **Variable**  | *Description* |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| policy_id | Unique identifier of the policyholder |
| policy_tenure | Time period of the policy |
| age_of_car | Normalized age of the car in years |
| age_of_policyholder | Normalized age of policyholder in years |
| area_cluster | Area cluster of the policyholder |
| population density | Population density of the city (Policyholder City) |
| make | Encoded Manufacturer/company of the car |
| segment | Segment of the car (A/ B1/ B2/ C1/ C2) |
| model | Encoded name of the car |
| fuel_type | Type of fuel used by the car |

| max_power | Maximum Power generated by the car (bhp@rpm) |
| engine_type | Type of engine used in the car |
| airbags | Number of airbags installed in the car |
| is_esc | Boolean flag indicating whether Electronic Stability Control (ESC) is present in the car or not. |
| is_adjustable_steering | Boolean flag indicating whether the steering wheel of the car is adjustable or not. |
| is_tpms | Boolean flag indicating whether Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is present in the car or not. |
| is_parking_sensors | Boolean flag indicating whether parking sensors are present in the car or not. |
| is_parking_camera | Boolean flag indicating whether the parking camera is present in the car or not. |
| rear_brakes_type | Type of brakes used in the rear of the car |
| displacement | Engine displacement of the car (cc) |
| cylinder | Number of cylinders present in the engine of the car |
| transmission_type | Transmission type of the car |

| steering_type | Type of the power steering present in the car |
| turning_radius | The space a vehicle needs to make a certain turn (Meters) |
| length | Length of the car (Millimetre) |
| width | Width of the car (Millimetre) |
| height | Height of the car (Millimetre) |
| gross_weight | The maximum allowable weight of the fully-loaded car, including passengers, cargo and equipment (Kg) |
| is_front_fog_lights | Boolean flag indicating whether front fog lights are available in the car or not. |
| is_rear_window_wiper | Boolean flag indicating whether the rear window wiper is available in the car or not. |
| is_rear_window_washer | Boolean flag indicating whether the rear window washer is available in the car or not. |
| is_rear_window_defogger | Boolean flag indicating whether rear window defogger is available in the car or not. |
| is_brake_assist | Boolean flag indicating whether the brake assistance feature is available in the car or not. |
| is_power_door_lock | Boolean flag indicating whether a power door lock is available in the car or not. |
| is_central_locking | Boolean flag indicating whether the central locking feature is available in the car or not. |
| is_power_steering | Boolean flag indicating whether power steering is available in the car or not. |
| is_driver_seat_height_adjustable | Boolean flag indicating whether the height of the driver seat is adjustable or not. |
| is_day_night_rear_view_mirror | Boolean flag indicating whether day & night rearview mirror is present in the car or not. |
| is_ecw | Boolean flag indicating whether Engine Check Warning (ECW) is available in the car or not. |
| is_speed_alert | Boolean flag indicating whether the speed alert system is available in the car or not. |
| ncap_rating | Safety rating given by NCAP (out of 5) |
| is_claim | Outcome: Boolean flag indicating whether the policyholder file a claim in the next 6 months or not. |

In order to select the relevant variables, I take a look at some online sources. The comparison website [Compare the Market](https://www.comparethemarket.com/car-insurance/content/what-impacts-upon-your-car-insurance/) provides some indications on the factors that impact car insurance premiums. The article claims that one's occupation, annual mileage, address, age, and driving history are important variables in determining one's insurance premium. Other factors include the make and model of your car, the place where the car is parked overnight, and the other drivers name in your insurance policy. Another article by the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/what-determines-price-my-auto-insurance-policy) claims that the main factors that influence insurance rates are one's driving record, mileage, location, age and car characteristics such as its (repair) cost, likelihood of theft and engine size {% marginfigure "pairs" '../assets/claim-pred/pairplot.jpeg' "Figure $1$: Pairs plot of chosen variables." %}.

| **Variable**  | *Description* |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| age_of_car | Normalized age of the car in years |
| age_of_policyholder | Normalized age of policyholder in years |
| area_cluster | Area cluster of the policyholder |
| population density | Population density of the city (Policyholder City) |
| make | Encoded Manufacturer/company of the car |
| segment | Segment of the car (A/ B1/ B2/ C1/ C2) |
| model | Encoded name of the car |
| engine_type | Type of engine used in the car |

The variables that most resembles those mentioned in the articles are in the table above and are plotted against each other in Figure $1$. In order for the plots to remain clear, onlya random selction of $1000$ observations of the dataset in plotted. However, it is still very difficult to make sense of the data. The visualization does not make any trend appear at first glance. It might be beneficial to plot the relationship between ```is_claim``` and the independent variables individually. but
