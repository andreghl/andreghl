{% marginnote 'disclaimer' "This project is inspired by the work of Andy Sloane, and relies heavily on the code written by Robert Moss. I translated his code from ```Julia``` to ```R```." %}

I have recently seen donuts written in ```C```, ```Python```, ```JavaScript```, and ```Julia```. This made me wonder if ```R```, a statistical programming language, could also be used to render such graphics. The answer seems to be yes! The code relies heavily on the ```cat()``` function to set the behavior of the donut in the terminal due to its ability to read what seems to be some standard notation format {% sidenote 'ASCII' "It seems to be called ASCII code." %}.

After downloading the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/andreghl/donut), the donut can **only** be rendered by opening a terminal and requires ```Rscript``` to be a PATH variable {% sidenote 'OS' "At least on Windows 11. On other operating systems, make sure that can be called from the terminal by running: ```Rscript --version```." %}. Below is a short animation of the script running on my computer.
