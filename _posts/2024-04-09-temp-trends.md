## Introduction

There exists a growing body of scientific research aimed at assessing the causes and effects of climate change and global warming in the world. While the causes are, today, well-established, it is important to estimate the temperature trends on a regional scale in order to correctly assess the effects on the local ecosystems and improve policymaking. The assignment focused on the Netherlands, a country known for its vulnerability to the rising sea levels and it is highly probable that a sizable increase in temperature would linfluence the likelihood of such phenomenon. The scope of our investigation was limited to 3 cities: De Bilt, Eelde, and Maastricht over the span of a century *(1907-2023)* and aimed to estimate the presence of a long-term trend in the daily, monthly, and annual temperature data provided by the course coordinator, [Prof. Stephen Smeekes](https://www.stephansmeekes.nl/).

## Research

The temperature data for the three cities can be thought of as the realization of three time series processes.
